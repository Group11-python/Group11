"SCOTT WHITE RECOMMENDATION

Scott has steered me to some great wines. Whispering angel ros√© , Honig SB, and this. 

I cringed a bit on the price but said I‚Äôm worth it. So glad I did. 

Lots of tropical and citrus flavors with a touch of oak. Peach on the finish. 

90 point wine enthusiast. ",talks about value for money,0.701507807
"This bottle is now seven years old. I saved it because I wanted to see how it might age. It‚Äôs still gorgeous, and one of my favorite whites. Softer, rounder, fuller.

"Stop. This is the one.  Better than Lail, Cuvasion or any other California Sav Blanc.  Measure all against this near perfect wine. Pale straw in color with notes of tropical fruit and lemon zest

Light bodied with crisp fruit expression.  Acidity comes in waves with a harmonious blend of fruit making this finish clean and dry. 

The palate is white peach, honey crisp apple, with hints of lime and tart kiwi

What impresses me most is this is a premium Sauvignon blanc isn‚Äôt overly fruity in an way like a lot of others but it has a mellow cornucopia of fruit.  Melon strawberry honey dew blueberry.

Open quite grassy and evolves to white peach, floral (frangipani), corn and a touch of vanilla.

We love Merry's Pinot's now I can add this fabulous Sav Blanc to my list of summer go to wines. The light Oak infusion is a wonderful touch and really takes this wine to a new level. We drank this a Bouchon's in Yountville and it's was a perfect pairing to my grilled Swordfish dish. Top marks to Merry for another wonderful masterpiece.,talks about food combinations,0.441011161
"A lovely if somewhat overpriced Sauvignon Blanc. This vibrant wine has a delicate floral fragrance of jasmine, honeysuckle, fruit blossoms, along with orange and lime zest. On the palate, fruit flavors donate with citrus and stone fruit, including white peach, nectarine, pink apple, and pear. For complexity, notes of fresh sweet bread, hazelnut, and dried flowers.

This was such a generous gift Boy a wonderful person I met through Vivino. One of my fav grapes in a different Style. 

Shiny yellow with golden hues. This is a heavier Style than I am used to. Med+ body and 14% vol. 
Scents of lemon, pineapple and papaya. Really juicy mouthfeel with an exotic touch. Tangy acidity but at the same time nearly a creamy texture. Long limey and fresh finish with some herbal notes.

"Tied with Mark David's Transitus as the best sauv blancs I've had. They managed to take a varietal I generally regard as simple with limited variation that attempts to win the crowd with sweetness, and made it into a sleek, finessed version that tamed the fruit and made this a serious wine. Reminds me of the new serious white zin trend, I could get used to more sauv blancs being made like this.",talks about taste,0.600971818
"An extremely well composed white Californian wine. Nice fragrance of jasmine, and honeysuckle. The palate is dominated by citrus, stone fruits and minerality. An exceptional fresh and delicate wine. I was introduced to this wine at a Danish restaurant. It is impossible to get this brand in Norway and Sweden (State monopoly in both countries). If anybody knows where to get hold of this wine please let me know. This wine got 93 points by Wine Spectator.

Highly recommended
             
Cheers my Vivino friends

"The Merry Edwards booth was a highlight of the wine show. There were six Pinot Noirs, a Chardonnay, and this outstanding Sauvignon Blanc. The addition of 30% Sauvignon Musqu√© gave this wine a completely new dimension, with notes of honeysuckle, cantaloupe, ginger, and white peach. A wet gravel minerality gave it some solid structure to balance the forward fruit. Far and away the most unique SB I've ever had. Worth every penny! ",talks about value for money,0.727849185

"Great Sauvignon Blanc, drunk from a magnum with a couple of years. This isn't built for age like a BDX Blanc, but the large format and a couple of years has definitely added layers.  Lots of tropical notes, with some guava, pineapple, elderflower, orange, and orange peel, with pineapple, key lime, and a little coconut on the palate. Some stone minerality too, and just a little nutty (cashew?) note.",talks about food combinations,0.603960097
"Merry Edwards 2020 Sauvignon Blanc. Done in French oak with a yeast stir every week for 10 weeks. Light straw color with a nose of honey, honeydew melon, casaba melon & floral.  The drink features notes of honeydew, casaba melon, mango, pear, peach, tropical, pink grapefruit, pineapple & vanilla on a French oak finish. This beautiful, SB will pair well with Asian food, seafood or chicken. A great stand-alone as well. Been a while since I've had a good SB.  4.5 stars.
